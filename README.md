## Supply Chain & Logistics Performance Analytics ##
**Tools Used:**  MySQL | Power BI 

## Project Overview: 
-This project focuses on analyzing supply chain data to identify logistics bottlenecks and sales performance. I built a relational database   using SQL and created an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights.

## Key Technical Steps:
1. **Data Analyze (SQL):** Created a database schema with 4 tables (Products, Suppliers, Logistics, Sales).
   - Performed Data Cleaning (Handling NULLs and Column Renaming).
   - Used **Window Functions (RANK)** to analyze shipping lead times.
2. **Data Visualization (Power BI):** - Integrated SQL data into Power BI.
   - Developed a dashboard to track **Carrier Performance** and **Regional Sales**.
   
## Business Insights: 
- Identified top-performing shipping carriers and those causing delays.
- Visualized revenue trends across different product categories.
